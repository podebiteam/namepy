# Version 1.0

# Region Detector

Knowing that every names from all over the world has a signatue,so it is how this script knowing where's each names comes from

# Example of Region Detector

Suryo wich is Javanese name,it's pretty easy to make some name-signature based on this case
s u r y o
0 1 2 3 4 

if name[0] == 's' and name[3] == 'y' or name[3] == 'w':then blahblahblah

# name_meaning_present() 
name meaning present using morewords.com service to know if each words/names which has been generated has a mean
still bugy and need more improvement.

# Present Bug 

- analyzing present name 
- knwoledge-base database is very poor

# Primitive Codes 
some codes of mine are pretty much primitive,i realized that
but,i won't loose the power of Python's simplicity
